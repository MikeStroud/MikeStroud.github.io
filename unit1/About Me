	<p><h1><strong>About Me</h1></strong></p>
	<p>I'm a marketing and communications professional, living in England. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to improve my understanding of websites and digital marketing.</p>
	<p><h2><strong>My Mission</strong></h2>
	As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a digital marketing guru with the Samoan Tourist Board, because I like to work in a beach hut on a tropical island.</p>
	<p><h2><strong>My Experience</strong></h2>
	This is how I've evolved professionally:
	<br>

	</p></ul>
	<p><h2><strong>Education</strong></h2>
	Business & Spanish degree, from Nottingham Trent University</p>
	<p><h2><strong>Other</strong></h2>
	I make terrible jokes. I used to be quite funny. I struggle to accept that this is no longer the case.</p>
